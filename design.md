## Design
### AES Mode
- **ECB/CBC** \[4\]
	- considered insecure for actual use
	- easiest to implement
- GCM
	- industry standard
	- requires dealing with authentication tags (which we probably don't need?)
	- hardest to implement
	- i couldn't find any existing implementations in Verilog
- XTS \[5\]
	- requires two keys,
	- typically used for disk encryption
	- somewhere between ECB/CBC and GCM in terms of difficulty of implementing
- CTR, OFB, CFB
	- stream ciphers so probably no need to consider

### C RegFile
small AES open-source implementation in \[3\] â€” which one?

### Salt
Unoptimized: TRNG \[1\]  
Optimized: PRNG seeded (and periodically reseeded) with TRNG \[2\] (must reseed at least every 624 PRNG generations)

Paper: "We use a Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) to generate cryptographic salts, re-seeded with a true random source every 200 uses. We used existing open-source encryption libraries within our simulation and parameterized gem5 with the above latencies."

Considerations:
- Verilog or C++? (paper uses C++ libraries for simulation)
